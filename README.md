# Cache_Simulator
CSCE 312 final project
The Cache Simulator is a python program that allows the user to simulate how a cache works, 
whether it be a direct mapped chace, or a set associative cache. The program does not include
the ability to simulate a fully associative cache, though. In order to get the cache to work,
we needed a way to store both the contents of the cache, as well as the contents of the main memory and ensure
that they spoke to each other correctly. Once done, we implemented the different policies for reading and 
writing a cache, as well as updating the main memory. We had to utilize python functions such as list indexing, 
loops, conditional statements, as well as file input/output. Our simulator allows for the curious programmer to understand the inner workings
of a cache, and how it might work on computers we know and use today.
